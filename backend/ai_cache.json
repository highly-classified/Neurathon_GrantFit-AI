We propose 'ClimateNexus,' a highly scalable platform designed to unify disparate climate datasets—from satellite observations and oceanographic sensors to complex climate model outputs—into a single, accessible, and collaborative environment. ClimateNexus offers robust data harmonization, real-time interactive visualization, and powerful analytical capabilities, enabling NOAA scientists to conduct advanced trend analysis, predictive modeling, and impact assessments with unprecedented speed.
