This highlights a universally valuable and effective learning strategy.\",\n  \"improvement_needed\": \"The pitch needs significant expansion on specific features, how 'crowd learning' is facilitated, and, most importantly, how it addresses a global education challenge, demonstrating scalability, impact, and relevance beyond local connections.\",\n  \"worse_part\": \"The complete absence of global context or scalability. The phrase 'around them' actively limits the scope, directly contradicting the implied requirements of a 'Global Education Initiative' without further explanation of how it could expand or serve diverse regions.\"\n}\n```",

This directly addresses a fundamental and globally relevant educational activity.\",\n  \"improvement_needed\": \"The pitch needs significant expansion. It should elaborate on: 1. The unique features or approach that differentiate this app from existing collaboration tools. 2. The specific global educational challenges it aims to address. 3. The target demographic (e.g., underserved regions, specific age groups, learning contexts). 4. How it ensures accessibility and inclusivity on a global scale. 5. Measurable impact on learning outcomes. 6. A vision for scalability and sustainability.\",\n  \"worse_part\": \"The most critical weakness is the extreme lack of detail and the complete absence of any connection to a 'Global Education Initiative'. The pitch is too generic, providing no unique value proposition or explanation of how it specifically contributes to global education goals, rather than just being another general study app.\"\n}\n```",
